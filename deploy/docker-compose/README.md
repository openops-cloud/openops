# Connections

## Azure

To use the Azure CLI block, you need to create a connection to Azure. If you use the OpenOps platform to create the connection, you will have to use a service principal.

However, it is possible to share your local session with the platform for local applications.
To do this, you need to set two environment variables:
- `OPS_ENABLE_HOST_SESSION=true`: enables sharing of the host session with the platform container.
- `HOST_AZURE_CONFIG_DIR=/root/.azure`: defines the path to the host machine's Azure configuration folder that will be shared with the platform container
