    "The analytics and permissions stack was modernized to be more maintainable and consistent across endpoints.",
    "Search filtering is now smoother and more consistent across the UI, reducing jittery updates while typing.",
    "Dynamic flag inputs now behave more predictably when switching modes, preventing unexpected empty or stale values.",
    "Operational logging is now more useful when engine executions fail, making failures easier to diagnose.",
