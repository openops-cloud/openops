## ✨ Improvements

- Improved documentation and UI guidance so it’s clearer what MCP can and cannot do and how to set up connections successfully
- Flow run retries now create a fresh run using the latest version of the flow, and the run list updates reliably after a retry
- Made the app’s tool execution lifecycle more consistent and less dependent on server-side UI assumptions
- Modernized the analytics and permissions stack to be more maintainable and consistent across endpoints
- Made search filtering smoother and more consistent across the UI, reducing jittery updates while typing
- Made dynamic flag inputs behave more predictably when switching modes, preventing unexpected empty or stale values
- Improved operational logging when engine executions fail to make failures easier to diagnose
- Upgraded AI/MCP dependencies to newer major versions to keep the platform current and compatible with upstream changes
- Made Chromatic runs more targeted to reduce unnecessary CI work when unrelated packages change
- Improved chat message parsing so hidden reasoning does not leak into displayed content, and fallback behavior is less aggressive
- Refreshed project metadata and licensing to stay current and accurate for 2026

## 🐛 Fixes

- Analytics access now defaults to “no access” when a user’s privileges or project permissions have not loaded yet, instead of briefly treating the user as allowed
