## ✨ Improvements

- Improved documentation and UI guidance so it’s clearer what MCP can and cannot do and how to set up connections successfully
- Workflow run retries now create a fresh run using the latest version of the workflow, and the run list updates reliably after a retry
- Improved tool runs to be more consistent and less dependent on server-side UI assumptions
- Improved analytics access handling and permissions checks for more consistent behavior across endpoints
- Made search filtering smoother and more consistent across the UI, reducing jittery updates while typing
- Made dynamic flag inputs behave more predictably when switching modes, preventing unexpected empty or stale values
- Improved error details for failed engine executions to make troubleshooting easier
- Updated MCP support to stay compatible with upstream changes
- Improved chat message parsing so hidden reasoning does not leak into displayed content, and fallback behavior is less aggressive

## 🐛 Fixes

- Analytics access now defaults to “no access” when a user’s privileges or project permissions have not loaded yet, instead of briefly treating the user as allowed
