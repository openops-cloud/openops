```json
{
  "✨": [
    "The assistant UI has refreshed styling for improved readability and consistency. This introduces a new `greyBlue-100` color token and adjusts typography classes (sizes, weights, and styles) for Markdown headings, paragraphs, and lists.",
    "Analytics deployment references were updated to the latest published image/version so environments stay aligned. Docker Compose and Helm values were updated from `0.14.1` to `0.14.2` for the analytics image/version references.",
    "Dependencies were updated to use a safer and newer brace expansion library version. The project now depends directly on `@isaacs/brace-expansion@5.0.1` after updating it to that version."
  ],
  "🐛": [
    "Password rules now correctly accept all supported special characters without edge-case failures. The password allowed-characters regex construction was refined and is now covered by a test that includes every allowed special character, including square brackets (`[` and `]`)."
  ],
  "🚀": [
    "Tool results and tool failures are now preserved and shown consistently during conversations. The system now propagates `tool-error` events end-to-end, persists them, streams them as structured outputs with `isError` flags, and wraps error tool outputs in an MCP-style `ToolResult`/tool-result message shape when merging into chat history.",
    "The chat experience now supports structured tool outputs from the frontend all the way to the server. The client extracts tool outputs from messages and forwards them as `ToolResult` objects, and the server inserts corresponding tool-result messages into chat history so tools render reliably.",
    "The Outlook “new email” trigger is now capped to avoid pulling too many messages at once. The trigger query now fetches at most 50 messages per polling request.",
    "The assistant now sends follow-up UI-tool messages more predictably after you finish interacting with UI tools. This adds a shared UI tool prefix constant and a custom autosend predicate that only triggers when UI tools in the last assistant step have completed.",
    "The AI model picker now shows clearer model identities across providers. The model selector and related chat UI now use provider-aware model metadata and display corresponding provider/model icons."
  ]
