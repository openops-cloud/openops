  "✨": [
    "Default deployments now ship with a newer OpenOps Tables version. The Docker Compose and Helm manifests were updated to point to newer `public.ecr.aws/openops/openops-tables` image tags (bumping across releases such as `0.2.15` → `0.2.17`) and to keep related version variables in sync.",
    "The Tables integration now uses the correct project-specific credentials when creating and looking up Tables MCP endpoints. It now resolves tokens via `resolveTokenProvider(...)` and uses them in `ensureTablesMcpEndpointExists` / `getMcpEndpointList` / `createMcpEndpoint`, matching endpoints by `workspace_id` and connecting via the endpoint `key` SSE URL.",
    "Initial admin seeding is now more reliable on fresh installs. The seed logic now correctly refreshes in-memory `organization`/`project` references after creation and consistently uses `organization.id` when building the seeded user context.",
    "Admin seeding now reuses an existing project’s OpenOps Tables workspace and database when available instead of always creating a new default. The seed flow now passes a `TablesWorkspaceContext` (workspaceId, databaseId, encrypted databaseToken) into `createDefaultWorkspaceAndDatabase`, which validates the provided IDs/token before falling back to creating new resources."
  ],
  "🐛": [
    "Chat transcripts now reliably include outputs from multiple tools running in parallel. The message-merge logic was updated to iterate and deterministically merge all `tool-result` parts (instead of only the first), preventing lost or overwritten results.",
    "Chat history no longer becomes corrupted when a run is interrupted (for example, by reloading the page). The abort/recovery path was updated to avoid partial writes and to persist the last consistent `chatHistory` state before calling `saveChatHistory()`.",
    "Chat streaming no longer continues past frontend UI tool invocations, preventing confusing partial responses after a UI action. The stream handler now stops using a `stopWhen` predicate when detecting `ui-` tool calls (via `UI_TOOL_PREFIX` / `hasToolCall`) and records explicit tool result messages for consistent history processing.",
    "The Analytics page now loads correctly when signing in from a redirected deep link. The `/analytics` route is no longer conditionally created at router initialization time and is instead protected by an `AnalyticsGuard` that uses `useHasAnalyticsAccess()` and redirects to `/` when access is missing.",
    "Upgrades no longer incorrectly block Analytics for users who already had an active session. The UI now treats an undefined `hasAnalyticsPrivileges` field as `true` in `authenticationSession.getUserHasAnalyticsPrivileges()` until the new session field is populated on the next sign-in."
  ],
  "🚀": [
    "You can now choose GPT‑5.2 when configuring OpenAI-powered steps in AI workflows. The OpenAI provider model allowlist and selector were updated to include `gpt-5.2` (including the dated variant `gpt-5.2-2025-12-11`) wherever supported OpenAI chat/completions models are enumerated.",
    "You can now run the platform without deploying or configuring the analytics service. The runtime and initialization logic was updated to support disabling analytics (for example via an `ANALYTICS_ENABLED` system property), skipping analytics seeding/auth flows and only exposing analytics UI/routes when access is available.",
    "Analytics is now only visible and usable to people who have the required privileges. The Analytics navigation and `/analytics` access are now gated by checks like `authenticationSession.getUserHasAnalyticsPrivileges()` plus server-side verification (`verifyUserAnalyticsAccess` / `authenticateAnalyticsRequest`)."
