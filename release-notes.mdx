```json
{
  "✨": [
    "The analytics deployment references were refreshed so new installs pull the latest published image version. Docker Compose and Helm values were updated to use analytics version `0.14.2` instead of `0.14.1`.",
    "Chat UI styling is more consistent and readable across the assistant experience. The UI added a `greyBlue-100` color token and updated typography classes for Markdown headings, paragraphs, and lists (including font sizes and weights).",
    "Automatic sending now waits until interactive UI tools have finished, reducing accidental early sends. A shared UI tool prefix constant and a custom autosend predicate were added so autosend only triggers when UI tools in the last assistant step are completed."
  ],
  "🐛": [
    "Passwords now accept the full intended set of special characters, including square brackets, without being incorrectly rejected. The password allowed-characters regex construction was refined and a new test was added to cover all allowed special characters (including `[` and `]`).",
    "The Outlook new-email trigger is less likely to time out or over-fetch by limiting how many messages it pulls in one request. The trigger now caps each query at 50 messages per fetch."
  ],
  "🚀": [
    "The AI model picker now shows clearer choices by displaying provider-specific names and icons in the chat interface. The model selector and related chat UI components now render provider-aware model metadata and icon assets.",
    "Tool results and failures are now reliably recorded and shown so you can understand what happened when a tool runs. Tool execution now propagates structured `ToolResult` objects end-to-end, persists and streams `tool-error` events with `isError` flags, and inserts MCP-style tool-result messages into chat history with updated merge logic and tests."
