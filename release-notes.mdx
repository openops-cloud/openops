This page lists OpenOps product release notes organized by version, with separate sections for new features, bug fixes, and other improvements.

## 🚀

- Released version 0.6.13 with configuration and maintenance improvements, plus a small bug fix.
- Updated the 0.6.13 release notes content to provide a concise, categorized summary of bug fixes and maintenance work in a consistent format.
- Standardized the creation of template tables across all projects so that new projects start with a consistent baseline of database structures.
- Updated the OpenOps database tables image to a newer version so environments use the latest compatible platform tables.
- Moved previously external OpenOps static images into the application so they now load directly from the product itself.
- Removed the legacy ENVIRONMENT system variable so configuration is now driven by clearer, more explicit settings.
- Exposed each project’s master status to the web application so the interface can distinguish master projects from regular projects after users sign in.

## 🐛

- Fixed a configuration issue so Docker-based deployments now read their settings from environment variables instead of hardcoded values.
- Fixed the Docker Compose configuration so it uses environment variables consistently instead of hardcoded values for different environments.
- Fixed the configuration used by local and development setups so they correctly pick up values from environment variables instead of hardcoded settings.
- Fixed the links in Microsoft Teams request messages so they now bring users back to their waiting OpenOps flow correctly.
- Fixed Slack request action buttons so they now direct users to the correct OpenOps page when clicked.
