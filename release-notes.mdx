### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- Breaking change: `isMasterProject` is renamed to `hasTemplatesPrivileges`, so update any custom integrations or scripts that reference it.

### 🚀 Improvements

- OpenOps can now start even when Analytics is disabled.
- Tables MCP endpoints are now created with the correct per-database token for reliable multi-workspace support.

### ✨ Enhancements

- Analytics access is now enforced consistently based on user permissions.
- OpenAI-powered workflows now support additional GPT‑5.2 model identifiers.
- Assistant messages now combine multi-tool outputs into a single response when appropriate.
- New deployments now use OpenOps Tables `0.2.17` by default.

### 🐛 Fixes

- The Analytics page now loads correctly after you sign in, even if you were redirected to the sign-in page first.
- Assistant chat history is now preserved when a run is interrupted or aborted.
- Chat streaming now stops after in-app tool calls to prevent extra background output.
- Analytics demo dashboard seeding now logs clearer errors when required seed data is missing.
- Admin setup and seeding is now more reliable when an admin already belongs to an organization or when multiple projects exist.
- Newly created objects now update reference fields immediately so related data appears up to date.
