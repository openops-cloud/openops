OpenOps release notes summarize new features, bug fixes, and improvements for each version.

## 🚀

- Improved project setup and data handling so that projects can use template tables more easily and users can immediately see whether their current project is the primary one.

## 🐛

- Fixed issues in Slack and Microsoft Teams approval messages so that action buttons and resume links always take users back to the correct request pages.

## ✨

- Refined project initialization and data safety so multi-project setups behave more reliably and avoid exposing confidential details.
- Simplified configuration and deployment so environments are easier to understand and operate for self-hosted and managed setups.
- Improved icons and static assets so interface graphics load more reliably directly from the application.
