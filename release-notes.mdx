### ✨ Improvements
- Default deployments now ship with a newer OpenOps Tables version
- The Tables integration now uses the correct project-specific credentials when creating and looking up Tables MCP endpoints
- Initial admin seeding is now more reliable on fresh installs
- Admin seeding now reuses an existing project’s OpenOps Tables workspace and database when available instead of always creating a new default

### 🐛 Fixes
- Chat transcripts now reliably include outputs from multiple tools running in parallel
- Chat history no longer becomes corrupted when a run is interrupted (for example, by reloading the page)
- Chat streaming no longer continues past frontend UI tool invocations, preventing confusing partial responses after a UI action
- The Analytics page now loads correctly when signing in from a redirected deep link
- Upgrades no longer incorrectly block Analytics for users who already had an active session

### 🚀 New
- You can now choose GPT‑5.2 when configuring OpenAI-powered steps in AI workflows
- You can now run the platform without deploying or configuring the analytics service
- Analytics is now only visible and usable to people who have the required privileges
