### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- **Authentication response field renamed**
  - The `AuthenticationResponse` field `isMasterProject` was renamed to `hasTemplatesPrivileges` for clearer template-permission semantics. Clients that read `isMasterProject` must update to the new field name.

### ✨

- **Analytics access control**
  - Analytics access is now limited to authorized users. The analytics UI and API enforce privilege checks (including gating navigation/routes) before granting access.
- **Optional analytics component**
  - OpenOps can now start and run even when Analytics is not configured or available. Analytics-dependent initialization (including seeding) is skipped when disabled or not configured.
- **Tables MCP endpoint provisioning**
  - Tables MCP endpoint creation now uses database tokens. This aligns endpoint provisioning with database-token authentication.
- **Updated default OpenOps Tables image**
  - Docker Compose and Helm defaults now pull a newer OpenOps Tables image by default. This delivers updated Tables fixes out of the box.

### 🐛

- **Preserve chat history on abort**
  - Chat history is now preserved when an in-progress run is aborted. This prevents earlier messages from becoming inconsistent or corrupted.
- **Stop streaming on UI tool actions**
  - Streaming output now stops when a UI tool action is triggered. This prevents the assistant from continuing to stream text unexpectedly.
- **More reliable admin bootstrap**
  - The initial admin bootstrap process is now more reliable in environments with multiple projects. Setup no longer fails due to cross-project assumptions during initialization.
- **Correct object references on create**
  - Newly created objects now keep correct references immediately after creation. This prevents stale or missing links between related resources.
- **More reliable analytics dashboard seeding**
  - Analytics dashboard seeding is now more reliable and no longer depends on a specific Tables admin user. Initial dashboards can be created more consistently with improved error logging when seeding fails.
- **Merge tool results into one assistant message**
  - Multiple tool results are now merged into a single assistant message instead of being emitted separately. This makes assistant tool outputs easier to follow.

### 🚀

- **OpenAI: GPT-5.2**
  - The OpenAI integration now supports the `gpt-5.2` model for compatible accounts. You can select it in provider configuration.
