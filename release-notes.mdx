## ✨

- 🛡️ Authentication improvements.
- Added a fixed salt for the default admin password to harden credential storage.
- Added configurable token expiration to the authentication service so tokens now expire automatically.
- Allowed public endpoints to declare `skipAuth=true` so they can be accessed without authentication while keeping protected routes unchanged.
