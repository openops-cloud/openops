{
  "⚠️ NOTICE": [
    "Breaking Change: This release renames a privilege flag used in project/session privilege checks, which may affect custom integrations that reference it."
  ],
  "✨": [
    "Analytics access is now enforced consistently based on user privileges across projects and sessions.",
    "OpenAI-based AI workflows now support additional GPT‑5.2 model identifiers for model selection.",
    "Assistant messages now present multi-tool outputs more cleanly by combining them into a single response when appropriate.",
    "The bundled OpenOps Tables service has been updated so new deployments use a newer default Tables image."
  ],
  "🐛": [
    "The Analytics page now loads correctly after you sign in, including when you were redirected to the login page first.",
    "Assistant conversations no longer end up with corrupted history when a run is interrupted or aborted.",
    "Streaming responses now stop at the right time after a UI tool call so the chat output does not continue generating in the background.",
    "Analytics demo dashboard seeding is now more resilient and easier to troubleshoot when required seed data is missing.",
    "Admin setup and seeding now works more reliably when an admin user already belongs to an organization or when multiple projects exist.",
    "Newly created objects now update their reference fields immediately so related data does not appear stale right after creation."
  ],
  "🚀": [
    "The application can now start and keep running even when analytics is unavailable or intentionally turned off.",
    "Tables MCP endpoints are now created with the correct token for each database so the integration works reliably across workspaces and projects."
