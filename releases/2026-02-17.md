{
  "🆕 New Features": [
    "A new secondary left sidebar panel was added so you can switch between the OpenOps Assistant chat and the Benchmark wizard without leaving the main UI. The app now renders a shared `SecondaryLeftSidePanelContainer` using `ResizablePanel`/`ResizableHandle` with `RESIZABLE_PANEL_IDS.SECONDARY_LEFT_SIDEBAR`, replacing the prior `AiChatResizablePanel` and expanding/collapsing based on `isAiChatOpened` and `isBenchmarkWizardOpen`.",
    "Clicking the FinOps benchmark banner now launches the benchmark wizard to help you start a benchmark flow from the home views. This wires the banner’s action to `useOpenBenchmarkWizard`, which sets `isBenchmarkWizardOpen` in the global store and closes AI chat first by toggling `isAiChatOpened` to `false` when needed.",
    "The benchmark wizard can now load step options dynamically and support provider-specific setup so the flow matches your cloud environment. It introduces a provider-adapter registry (initially with an AWS adapter) and resolves step options via static config or adapter methods like `listConnections` backed by `appConnectionService.list` filtered to active connections for the current project/provider.",
    "New wizard-building UI components were added to make multi-step flows clearer and easier to navigate. The UI components package now exports a wizard component set (with Storybook examples), plus reusable building blocks like `StepCounter`, `SelectForm`, and `SelectAllCheckbox` (used in the builder multi-select property).",
    "A new FinOps benchmark banner can now be shown on supported home views to highlight the benchmark experience when it’s enabled. This introduces the `FINOPS_BENCHMARK_ENABLED` feature flag (default `false`) that gates rendering of the banner and related UI."
  ],
  "🎁 Misc": [
    "The bundled analytics library was updated so you receive upstream maintenance updates and compatibility improvements. This bumps the analytics component version from `0.14.2` to `0.14.4` across Docker and Helm configurations.",
    "Dependency versions were refreshed to keep request/query parsing behavior current and reduce exposure to outdated transitive code. The `qs` package was bumped from `6.11.2` to `6.14.2` (including an internal dependency metadata update referenced as PR #1949 / commit `cfcf842c5c5d828c5fc419084ce640fb6a22bff0`).",
    "OpenAPI endpoints were adjusted so API documentation routes work without requiring authentication and are easier to maintain. All `/v1/openapi` routes now skip auth and the OpenAPI route prefix is centralized for consistent routing.",
    "Authentication handling was modernized to improve session security and simplify client responsibilities. The system now switches from client-managed JWTs to HttpOnly cookies, updates project/user metadata handling and AI chat token sourcing, and adds supporting endpoints and tests.",
    "Federated login and cloud-connection flows now avoid unnecessary cloud user calls so the UI does less background work in those modes. Feature flags now skip cloud user API calls and polling when federated login is enabled and disable the cloud user query when the cloud connection page is enabled.",
    "Telemetry test timing was stabilized to prevent flaky results caused by inconsistent time mocking. The Logz.io telemetry test now uses Jest fake timers and controlled system time instead of mocking `Date` directly.",
    "Logout behavior was simplified so signing out consistently uses the same session mechanism across the app. The guard no longer calls `FronteggApp.logout` and always uses `authenticationSession.logOut` instead."
  ],
  "🐜 Bug Fixes": [
    "Unauthenticated requests to the user settings endpoint now return the correct error response so clients can reliably handle login-required scenarios. The user settings API now returns the expected unauthenticated error payload/status when requests are missing valid authentication credentials.",
    "Private endpoints now respond consistently when you are not logged in, instead of returning incorrect statuses in some cases. Routes requiring authentication now return HTTP 401 when no token/cookie is provided and user metadata is only fetched when the session is authenticated.",
    "Access-token authentication behavior was corrected so missing credentials are treated as unauthenticated rather than forbidden. Private routes without a token now return HTTP 401 (not 403), and the access-token handler once again only processes requests that actually include a token, with tests updated accordingly."
