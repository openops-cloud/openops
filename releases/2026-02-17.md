# Release 0.100.0 (2026-02-17)

## 🆕 New Features

- Added a secondary left sidebar so you can switch between the OpenOps Assistant chat and the FinOps benchmark wizard without leaving the main UI.
- Added a FinOps benchmark banner action that launches the benchmark wizard from supported home views.
- Added provider-aware benchmark wizard steps that load options dynamically based on your cloud environment (starting with AWS).
- Added wizard UI components to make multi-step flows clearer and easier to navigate.
- Added the `FINOPS_BENCHMARK_ENABLED` feature flag (default `false`) to control whether the FinOps benchmark banner and related UI are shown.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed unauthenticated responses for the user settings endpoint so clients receive the correct login-required error.
- Fixed private endpoints to consistently return HTTP 401 when you are not logged in and no session is present.
- Fixed access-token authentication so missing credentials are treated as unauthenticated (HTTP 401) instead of forbidden (HTTP 403).

## 🎁 Misc

- Updated OpenOps Analytics to `0.14.4` (from `0.14.2`) in Docker and Helm deployments.
- Updated `qs` to `6.14.2` (from `6.11.2`) to keep query parsing behavior current (PR #1949).
- Improved OpenAPI documentation routing by skipping auth for `/v1/openapi` and centralizing the OpenAPI route prefix.
- Improved authentication by switching from client-managed JWTs to HttpOnly cookies and adding supporting endpoints and tests.
- Improved federated login and cloud-connection flows by skipping unnecessary cloud user API calls and polling when those modes are enabled.
- Stabilized telemetry tests by using Jest fake timers and controlled system time.
- Simplified logout so signing out always uses the same session mechanism across the app.
