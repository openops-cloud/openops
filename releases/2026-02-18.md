- Date: 2026-02-18
- Version: 0.100.0

<!--
Raw release notes input (do not ship in final):

{
  "🆕 New Features": [
    "Users can now start a guided FinOps benchmark flow directly in the product. This adds a multi-step benchmark wizard (UI + service), a “Run a benchmark” entry path, and a Benchmarks API endpoint that is gated behind the `FINOPS_BENCHMARK_ENABLED` feature flag (default: `false`).",
    "Users can now open the benchmark wizard from Home via the FinOps benchmark banner and use a shared left-side resizable panel for both the assistant chat and the benchmark wizard. This introduces `useOpenBenchmarkWizard` to coordinate `isBenchmarkWizardOpen`/`isAiChatOpened`, and updates the global layout to `SecondaryLeftSidePanelContainer` using `RESIZABLE_PANEL_IDS.SECONDARY_LEFT_SIDEBAR`.",
    "Users can now see benchmark wizard step options that change based on the selected provider. The server resolves step options from either static values or provider adapter methods (including AWS option resolution such as listing active app connections), and it validates unknown providers/option methods via centralized `throwValidationError`."
  ],
  "🎁 Misc": [
    "The platform now avoids unnecessary session and user lookups in certain configurations and makes OpenAPI routes easier to expose safely. This skips cloud user API calls and polling when federated login is enabled, can disable the cloud user query when the cloud connection page is enabled, and centralizes the OpenAPI route prefix while marking `/v1/openapi` routes to skip auth.",
    "Logout behavior is now more consistent across the app. The guard no longer calls `FronteggApp.logout` and always uses `authenticationSession.logOut`.",
    "Dependencies and packaged components were refreshed to keep the platform up to date. This updates the analytics component from `0.14.2` to `0.14.4` across Docker and Helm configurations, and bumps `qs` from `6.11.2` to `6.14.2` while refreshing `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`.",
    "Test timing in telemetry was made more reliable to reduce flaky failures. The telemetry Logz.io test now uses Jest fake timers and a controlled system time instead of mocking `Date` directly."
  ],
  "🐜 Bug Fixes": [
    "Private endpoints now correctly respond with 401 when a request is missing an access token. The private-route authentication flow was updated so missing-token requests are treated as `Unauthorized` (401) and the related tests were aligned to match the final behavior."
