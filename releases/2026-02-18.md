# Release 0.100.0

Released on 2026-02-18.

## 🆕 New Features

- Added a guided **FinOps benchmark** flow (gated behind `FINOPS_BENCHMARK_ENABLED`, default: `false`) that can be started directly in-product.
- Added the ability to open the benchmark wizard from Home via the FinOps benchmark banner in a shared, left-side resizable panel with the assistant chat.
- Added provider-aware benchmark wizard step options that change based on the selected provider.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed private endpoints so they return 401 when requests are missing an access token.

## 🎁 Misc

- Improved API performance and safety by avoiding unnecessary session and user lookups in certain configurations and by centralizing the OpenAPI route prefix, with `/v1/openapi` routes skipping auth.
- Improved logout consistency across the app by removing `FronteggApp.logout` from the guard and always using `authenticationSession.logOut`.
- Updated bundled dependencies and components, including analytics `0.14.2`→`0.14.4` (Docker + Helm) and `qs` `6.11.2`→`6.14.2`, and refreshed `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`.
- Improved telemetry test reliability by switching the Logz.io test to Jest fake timers and a controlled system time instead of mocking `Date` directly.
