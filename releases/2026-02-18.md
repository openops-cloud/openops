# Release 0.100.0

Released on 2026-02-18.

## 🆕 New Features

- Added a guided **FinOps benchmark** flow that can be started directly in-product. This includes a multi-step benchmark wizard (UI + service), a “Run a benchmark” entry path, and a Benchmarks API endpoint gated behind `FINOPS_BENCHMARK_ENABLED` (default: `false`).
- Added the ability to open the benchmark wizard from Home via the FinOps benchmark banner and use a shared left-side resizable panel for both the assistant chat and the benchmark wizard. This introduces `useOpenBenchmarkWizard` to coordinate `isBenchmarkWizardOpen`/`isAiChatOpened` and updates the global layout to `SecondaryLeftSidePanelContainer` using `RESIZABLE_PANEL_IDS.SECONDARY_LEFT_SIDEBAR`.
- Added provider-aware benchmark wizard step options that change based on the selected provider. The server resolves step options from static values or provider adapter methods (including AWS option resolution such as listing active app connections) and validates unknown providers/option methods via centralized `throwValidationError`.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed private endpoints so they return 401 when requests are missing an access token. The private-route authentication flow now treats missing-token requests as `Unauthorized` (401), and related tests were updated to match.

## 🎁 Misc

- Improved performance and safety of API exposure by avoiding unnecessary session and user lookups in certain configurations and by making OpenAPI routes easier to expose safely. This skips cloud user API calls and polling when federated login is enabled, can disable the cloud user query when the cloud connection page is enabled, centralizes the OpenAPI route prefix, and marks `/v1/openapi` routes to skip auth.
- Improved logout consistency across the app by removing `FronteggApp.logout` from the guard and always using `authenticationSession.logOut`.
- Updated bundled dependencies and components, including updating analytics from `0.14.2` to `0.14.4` (Docker + Helm) and bumping `qs` from `6.11.2` to `6.14.2`. This also refreshes `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`.
- Improved telemetry test reliability by switching the Logz.io test to Jest fake timers and a controlled system time instead of mocking `Date` directly.
