- Version: 0.100.0

## Source data

```json
{
  "🆕 New Features": [
    "You can now store and work with time-based records using a new Timeseries template table in OpenOps Tables. The Timeseries template table is created with a UUID primary key named \"ID\" and is seeded with fields like Date, Value, Workflow, Type, Description, Service, and Account.",
    "You can now create virtual analytics datasets from a SQL query. The analytics dataset creation helper supports an optional non-empty `sql` field and can create virtual dataset types via the updated dataset creation flow (PR #1958)."
  ],
  "🎁 Misc": [
    "Template tables are now kept consistent across environments by automatically seeding the Timeseries template table at server startup. The startup seed is idempotent by recording completion with a FlagEntity marker and skipping when the seed flag is already set, and the seed flag constant was later renamed to a shorter string value.",
    "The app can now explicitly reconnect its socket connection when needed to recover from connectivity issues. The UI-kit socket context exports `reconnectSocket`, which calls `disconnect()` then `connect()` when `socket.connected` is already true, and calls `connect()` directly when it is not connected.",
    "Dependency installation is now more reliable across environments by correcting a corrupted lockfile entry. The `package-lock.json` entry for `@rollup/rollup-linux-arm-gnueabihf` was fixed from version `4.200` to `4.20.0` and was completed with `resolved`, `integrity`, and CPU/OS metadata (PR #1966).",
    "Security and stability were improved by updating Axios to a newer release. This change bumped `axios` from 1.12.1 to 1.13.5 and includes upstream fixes such as a Denial of Service fix in `mergeConfig` involving the `__proto__` key (PR #1935).",
    "Build tooling was updated to keep the project’s bundling stack current. This change bumped `webpack` from 5.94.0 to 5.105.2 and refreshed the lockfile and third-party license listings to match (PR #1948).",
    "Markdown rendering dependencies were refreshed to the latest supported versions. This change bumped `markdown-it` to 14.1.1 and updated the lockfile and third-party license metadata to reflect the new dependency set (PR #1950).",
    "CI and release automation workflows were updated to use newer GitHub Actions versions. This change bumped actions like `chromaui/action`, `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` to v6.0.0, and `docker/build-push-action` in `.github/workflows/*` (PR #1953).",
    "Deployment configs were updated to use a newer analytics service image. This change bumped the analytics service version from 0.14.4 to 0.14.5 in Docker Compose and Helm configurations."
