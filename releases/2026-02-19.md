# Release 0.100.0

Date: 2026-02-19

## 🆕 New Features

- Added a Timeseries template table in OpenOps Tables for time-based records with a UUID primary key (`ID`) and fields like Date, Value, Workflow, Type, Description, Service, and Account.
- Added support for creating virtual datasets in OpenOps Analytics from a SQL query via the optional non-empty `sql` field ([#1958](https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/pull/1958)).

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed inconsistent availability of the Timeseries template table by idempotently seeding it at server startup using a FlagEntity marker.
- Fixed socket reconnection recovery issues by adding `reconnectSocket` to the UI-kit socket context.
- Fixed dependency installation failures caused by a corrupted `package-lock.json` entry for `@rollup/rollup-linux-arm-gnueabihf` by correcting the version to `4.20.0` and restoring metadata ([#1966](https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/pull/1966)).

## 🎁 Misc

- Updated `axios` from 1.12.1 to 1.13.5 to include upstream security fixes ([#1935](https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/pull/1935)).
- Updated `webpack` from 5.94.0 to 5.105.2 and refreshed the lockfile and third-party licenses ([#1948](https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/pull/1948)).
- Updated `markdown-it` to 14.1.1 and refreshed the lockfile and third-party license metadata ([#1950](https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/pull/1950)).
- Updated GitHub Actions versions used by CI and release workflows, including `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` v6.0.0 ([#1953](https://github.com/openops-cloud/openops/pull/1953)).
- Updated the OpenOps Analytics service image from 0.14.4 to 0.14.5 in Docker Compose and Helm configurations.
