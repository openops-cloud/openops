  "🆕 New Features": [
    "You can now create analytics datasets as virtual datasets backed by a SQL query, which makes it easier to define datasets without materializing new tables. Dataset creation accepts an optional `sql` field (trimmed and validated as non-empty) and routes the request through a `createVirtualDataset` helper that delegates to the shared `createDataset` implementation."
  ],
  "🎁 Misc": [
    "The server now automatically ensures the built-in timeseries template table exists during startup, reducing manual setup and preventing missing-table issues. On initialization, a seed routine checks each tables database for `TIMESERIES_TABLE_NAME`, creates it when missing, and records completion with a `FlagEntity` so later startups skip the work; the seed-flag constant was also renamed to a shorter value.",
    "Real-time updates now recover more reliably after a dropped connection by using a single, reusable reconnection routine. A shared `reconnectSocket` helper coordinates `socket.disconnect()` and `socket.connect()` based on `socket.connected`, replacing ad-hoc reconnection logic.",
    "Analytics dataset creation now supports an optional “recreate if exists” mode so you can replace an existing dataset in one step. The `createDataset` helper accepts a `recreateIfExists` flag and, when enabled, deletes the existing dataset via `deleteDataset` before creating the replacement dataset.",
    "The bundled analytics service has been updated to a newer version to pick up upstream improvements. Docker Compose and Helm configurations now reference analytics service version `0.14.5` (up from `0.14.4`).",
    "Dependency resolution for installs has been corrected to avoid pulling an invalid package version during setup. The `package-lock.json` entry for `@rollup/rollup-linux-arm-gnueabihf` was fixed from `4.200` to `4.20.0` and completed with the correct `resolved`/`integrity` and platform metadata.",
    "HTTP client dependencies were updated to incorporate upstream fixes and keep the project current. `axios` was bumped from `1.12.1` to `1.13.5` and the lockfile and third-party license list were updated accordingly (#1935).",
    "Build tooling has been refreshed to a newer webpack release to stay aligned with upstream maintenance and security updates. `webpack` was bumped from `5.94.0` to `5.105.2`, with corresponding lockfile and license-list updates (PR #1948).",
    "Markdown rendering dependencies were updated to the latest patch release to keep output consistent and up to date. `markdown-it` was bumped to `14.1.1` and the lockfile and third-party license metadata were refreshed.",
    "CI and release workflows have been updated to newer GitHub Actions versions to improve reliability and keep automation current. Workflow dependencies were bumped for `chromaui/action` (15.1.0), `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` (6.0.0), and `docker/build-push-action` (6.19.2) (PR #1953)."
