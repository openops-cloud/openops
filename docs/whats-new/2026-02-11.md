# What's new (2026-02-11)

- **Date:** 2026-02-11
- **Version:** 0.100.0

## 🆕 New Features

```json
{
  "🆕 New Features": [
    "Benchmark results can now be saved so they can be reviewed and queried later.",
    "User verification can now be performed against multiple allowed public keys. This introduces a helper that checks signatures against multiple keys and is used by the cloud-template controller.",
    "Outlook email attachments now support inline-related metadata so embedded content renders correctly in messages. This adds inline-related fields to attachment handling and forwards them into the Microsoft Graph payload.",
    "Telemetry events now include the environment name to make it easier to segment and troubleshoot behavior across deployments. This adds an environment name label derived from system configuration to emitted telemetry events."
  ],
  "🎁 Misc": [
    "Automated tests now produce less noise in GitHub CI logs, making failures easier to spot. This forwards Jest’s `--silent` flag through `nx run-many` in the CI workflow.",
    "The webhooks sync endpoint is now less likely to fail during long-running operations. This makes NGINX timeouts configurable for `/api/v1/webhooks/*/sync`.",
    "Azure authentication now rejects invalid configurations earlier with clearer failures. This adds shared validation of required Azure credential fields and uses it in both CLI login and BlockAuth validation to fail fast.",
    "Benchmark API contracts are now centralized to reduce duplication across packages. This adds shared TypeBox DTOs and types for benchmark-related APIs and exports them from the shared package.",
    "CI workflow dependencies were refreshed to keep automation up to date. This updates GitHub workflow files to newer versions of actions such as `actions/checkout`, `actions/cache`, and `chromaui/action`."
  ],
  "🐜 Bug Fixes": [
    "The Test Run Limits form now prevents invalid values and behaves more predictably when numeric fields are cleared. This enforces schema-based validation and updates `NumericInput` to reset to the minimum value when its content is cleared.",
    "Approval and disapproval links now open through the proper resume page instead of exposing raw backend links. This wraps approval/disapproval URLs using a frontend resume page URL rather than returning backend resume URLs directly."
  ]
}

```
