{
  "🆕 New Features": [
    "Benchmark results can now be saved so you can review and query them later. This adds database persistence via new `benchmark` and `benchmark_flow` tables plus TypeORM entities/repositories and a migration with indexes/relations (PR #1916, commit 9e97a4280c30640f6193e6f5b4cf614b4f7b36cf).",
    "Benchmark integrations are now easier to keep consistent across clients and services. This exposes shared benchmark API types/DTOs from the shared package (PR #1921).",
    "Azure authentication now checks your configuration up front to catch problems earlier. This introduces a `validate` function (and shared credential validation used by CLI login and BlockAuth validation) in the Azure auth implementation (PR #1923).",
    "The Microsoft Outlook `send-email` action can now send files with your messages. This adds attachment support and forwards inline-related attachment fields into the Microsoft Graph payload (PR #1927)."
  ],
  "🎁 Misc": [
    "Synchronous webhook synchronization is less likely to fail due to short request timeouts. This increases the configured NGINX proxy timeout for `/api/v1/webhooks/*/sync` to reduce premature timeouts during sync-mode webhook calls (PR #1913).",
    "GitHub CI logs are now less noisy when running tests. This forwards Jest’s `--silent` flag through `nx run-many` in the GitHub CI configuration (PR #1893).",
    "GitHub Actions workflows were updated to stay current with upstream improvements. This bumps shared workflow actions such as `actions/checkout`, `actions/cache`, and `chromaui/action` (PR #1905).",
    "Approval and disapproval links now open in a flow that better matches the approval experience. This wraps the generated resume URLs in a frontend resume-page URL in the `create-approval-link` action instead of returning raw backend resume URLs (PR #1922).",
    "Telemetry is now easier to filter across deployments. This adds the environment name as a field/label in telemetry payloads based on system configuration (PR #1926)."
  ],
  "🐜 Bug Fixes": [
    "Cloud template signature verification is now more reliable when keys rotate or multiple keys are configured. This updates the cloud-templates controller to verify signatures against multiple public keys (PR #1919).",
    "The Test Run Limits dialog now rejects invalid values more consistently. This enforces the schema-based validation on the form and updates `NumericInput` to default back to the minimum value when cleared (PR #1918)."
  ]
