# 0.6.2

🚀 New Features
- Added a **Test Run Limits** dialog with `NumericInput` controls and configurable min/max values (1–99) to set execution limits
- Introduced notifications in Test Run Details when action limits are reached, with a button to open the limits configuration
- Enabled dynamic variable resolution in object keys for more flexible workflow configurations
- Enhanced **ServiceNow** integration with new API actions to create, retrieve, update, delete, and list records
- Added new **Microsoft Teams** OAuth scopes for chat and team basic reading permissions
- Included **Haiku 4.5** model variants in the Anthropic and Google Vertex providers

🐛 Bug Fixes
- Handle `tool-error` cases in the chat message stream to prevent validation issues
- Display a fallback “Unknown Error” message in the TestActionSection when error text is undefined
- Preserve existing test-run action limits when merging recalculated settings
- Fix connection-name validation logic in the Connection Selection component
- Prevent previous version’s test-run action limits from merging into draft flows
- Improve engine-request error handling by showing error details and disabling options on failure

✨ Performance Improvements
- Integrated **Langfuse** telemetry support for the Ask AI action, enabling optional telemetry data collection
- Enforce execution limits in flows: automatically stop runs when limits are reached and surface an “execution limit reached” status
