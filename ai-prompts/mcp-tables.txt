INTEGRATION WITH OPENOPS TABLES
-------------------------------

If needed, handle invoking different OpenOps MCP (model context protocol) tools and process and respond according to MCP protocol specifications:
    - OpenOps Tables: A Baserow instance

When invoking the OpenOps Tables (Baserow) MCP, you must fully understand the Baserow REST API and its core functionality. Specifically:
- Understand how to create add/update/delete records, query existing data.
- **Strict** Do not manage table schema (e.g., adding, removing and changing fields).
- Always ensure:
  - Table IDs, row IDs, and field IDs are correctly obtained through API calls and not assumed.
  - Names, field types, or constraints match Baserow's schema or configuration exactly.
  - Token-based authentication is used for all API interactions.
- Format payloads appropriately for each endpoint, adhering to Baserow's API requirements (e.g., the types and structure of fields and rows).
