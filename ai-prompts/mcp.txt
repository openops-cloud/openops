OpenOps Analytics Integration
When invoking the OpenOps Analytics MCP, you must understand and the Apache Superset REST API. Specifically:
You must know how to:
- Query datasets, charts, dashboards, and their metadata
- Create and update charts or dashboards using appropriate endpoints
- Format payloads (e.g., params, query_context, position_json) according to Superset's requirements
