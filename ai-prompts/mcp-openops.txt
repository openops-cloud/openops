# App Connection Guide

## Important Rules
- Never remove or overwrite existing roles or other fields unless explicitly requested
- Never ask for redacted or secret fields unless the user wants to change them
- For PATCH operations: Always use the full, current connection object as the base
- For POST operations: Only require the minimum information needed for a new connection
- **Never ask for fields that are already specified in the metadata** (like `type` or `authProvider`),
  for block information like blockName, use the default block or the first one in the list in supportedBlocks of the metadata.

## Operation Types
- **POST**: For creating new connections
- **PATCH**: For updating existing connections (requires existing connection ID)

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Verify Required Fields
- Call the **get metadata** endpoint to fetch required fields for the connection type
- Use metadata to populate system-provided fields (e.g., authProvider, type)
- **Do not ask the user for fields that are specified in the metadata**
- If any required fields are missing (not provided by user or not existing in the metadata), request them from the user

### 2. For PATCH Operations Only: Find Existing Connection
- Use the **list endpoint** to find the connection by name or ID
- Use the **get endpoint** with the connection ID to fetch the complete current connection object

### 3. For PATCH Operations Only: Prepare Update
- Start with a complete copy of the existing connection object
- Only modify fields explicitly requested by the user
- If user requests changes to non-existent fields, find equivalent fields and ask for confirmation
- For array modifications:
  - To add: Append new items to existing array
  - To remove/update: Modify specific items as requested
- Preserve all other existing fields and array items

### 4. Send Request
- Use **POST endpoint** for new connections
- Use **PATCH endpoint** for updates
- Backend will handle validation, encryption, and secret redaction

### 5. Confirm Changes
- Return the updated/created connection details
- Only show fields that were modified or created

## Example Scenarios

### Creating New Connection
1. Get metadata for connection type
2. Collect required fields from user
3. Send POST request
4. Confirm creation

### Updating Connection
1. Get metadata for connection type
2. Find existing connection
3. Get current connection details
4. Apply requested changes
5. Send PATCH request
6. Confirm updates

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Asking for fields that are already specified in the metadata (like `type` or `authProvider`)
- Not using the metadata-provided values for system fields
- Asking for optional fields unless specifically needed
- Modifying fields that weren't requested by the user
