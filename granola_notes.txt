Task Breakdown Structure





Breaking down AWS Assessment project into manageable tickets





Focus on smaller projects within main project rather than granular tasks



Sub-tickets will be created by implementers as needed



Main components identified:





UI Wizard for multi-step flow



TypeScript types in shared repo



UI components for forms



Multi-step frontend logic



Connection model implementation



Data following UI

Frontend Requirements





AI Chat panel extension needed first





Support assessment view functionality



Home frontend updates





New banner with link as per Figma design



Missing design element identified





Frontend needs to know if active assessment exists



Need linking mechanism to existing assessments



Site navigation changes required for AI chat panel

Backend Implementation





Two main backend tickets created:





API changes (wizard backend implementation)



Database changes (separate ticket)



API endpoints needed:





Wizard endpoint for multi-step flow



Run assessment endpoint



Create assessment endpoint



Assessment status endpoint (for polling)



Database considerations:





Soft delete implementation instead of hard delete



Status tracking for assessment completion



Integration with existing runs table for orchestrator status

Superset Dashboard Integration





Two approaches identified for dashboard promotion:





Native export/import (problematic due to hardcoded IDs)



Programmatic creation via API calls (more flexible but complex)



Current approach: Programmatic creation similar to homepage implementation





Requires coding each chart and dashboard component



Difficult to maintain but necessary for cross-environment compatibility



POC tasks:





Support extra table functionality



Import full dashboard including charts and datasets



Handle dynamic table names from BaseRow

Action Items & Next Steps





Cezar: Delete outdated documents and mark design doc as final



Team: Schedule validation meeting with Rita for strategy approval



Ravi: Review design document thoroughly and ask questions



Marcelo: Add detailed sub-tickets to backend implementation



Alexandru-Dan: Review SSO PR after sync meeting



All: Validate naming convention (assessment vs benchmark vs campaigns)



Database ticket: Add soft delete parameter and status tracking



First phase tickets can start in parallel once Rita approves strategy
