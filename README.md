## **üòé What is OpenOps?**
[OpenOps](https://openops.com) is a **No-Code FinOps automation platform** that helps organizations reduce cloud costs and streamline financial operations.

It provides **customizable workflows** to automate key FinOps processes like allocation, unit economics, anomaly management, workload optimization, safe de-provisioning and much, much more. 

It also comes bundled with its own Excel-like database ([**OpenOps Tables**](https://docs.openops.com/reporting-analytics/tables)) and its own visualization system ([**OpenOps Analytics**](https://docs.openops.com/reporting-analytics/data-visualization)).

At the same time, OpenOps enables collaboration between **FinOps teams, engineers, DevOps, finance, and leadership**, ensuring that cost-saving measures are not just identified but effectively implemented.

OpenOps **integrates seamlessly** with major cloud providers, many third-party FinOps tools, varoious communication platforms and a handful of project management tools.

## **üåü Why OpenOps?**

FinOps practitioners struggle with **visibility tools** that surface cost-saving opportunities but lack implementation capabilities. Traditional automation tools, whether **custom-built** or **off-the-shelf**, fail to balance flexibility and maintainability.

OpenOps solves these challenges by:

* **Consolidating** optimization opportunities from native and third-party FinOps visibility tools.
* **Suggesting** practical optimization actions.
* **Enabling customization** of pre-built optimizations or authoring new ones.

With OpenOps, organizations can automate cloud cost optimization, ensuring that FinOps processes are efficient, actionable, and aligned with business goals.

OpenOps integrates with a broad range of platforms, including cloud providers, databases, FinOps tools, communication platforms, and task management services.
