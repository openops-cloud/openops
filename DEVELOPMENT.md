# OpenOps Development Guide

## Environment-Aware Build System

This document explains the environment-aware development workflow that provides dramatically improved build times for local development while maintaining production stability.

## Environment Separation Strategy

### üê≥ **Production (Docker)**

- **Behavior**: Exactly like main branch (original approach)
- **Linking**: Simple global npm links (`find dist | xargs npm link`)
- **Webpack**: Original block watching approach
- **Builds**: Full builds of all blocks
- **Reliability**: ‚úÖ Proven stable production behavior

### üõ†Ô∏è **Development (Local)**

- **Behavior**: Enhanced with performance improvements
- **Linking**: Smart symlinks + incremental linking
- **Webpack**: Intelligent block watching + build coordination
- **Builds**: ‚ö° Only changed blocks (8x faster)
- **Performance**: ‚ö° Dramatically improved hot reload

## Key Development Improvements

### ‚ö° Incremental Block Building

- **Before**: All ~40 blocks rebuilt on every change (1-2 minutes)
- **After**: Only changed blocks are rebuilt (5-15 seconds)

### üéØ Smart Webpack Watching

- **Before**: Entire `/packages/blocks/` folder watched, triggering both servers
- **After**: Individual block directories watched with coordinated builds

### üîÑ Build Coordination

- **Before**: Both API and Engine servers rebuild blocks independently
- **After**: API server handles builds, Engine server just restarts

### üì¶ Selective Package Linking

- **Before**: All blocks re-linked after every build
- **After**: Only changed blocks are linked

## Development Workflow

### Quick Start

```bash
# Fast development startup (only builds changed blocks)
npm run dev:fast

# Regular development (builds all blocks first)
npm run dev
```

### Manual Block Operations

```bash
# Build only changed blocks (development only)
npm run build:blocks:changed

# Build all blocks (full rebuild)
npm run build:blocks

# Link all blocks for global access
npm run link:blocks

# Link blocks for engine module resolution (development only)
npm run link:blocks:engine

# Link framework and shared packages for API server (development only)
npm run link:framework

# Link specific blocks (development only)
./tools/link-packages-to-root.sh block-name1 block-name2
```

### Development Tips

1. **First Time Setup**: Run `npm run dev` (builds all blocks)

2. **Daily Development**: Use `npm run dev:fast` (incremental builds)

3. **After Git Pull**: Run `npm run build:blocks:changed` if blocks were modified

4. **Clean State**: Delete `dist/` folder and run `npm run build:blocks` for full rebuild

## How Environment Detection Works

The system automatically detects the environment and adjusts behavior:

### Detection Logic

```javascript
// Production detection
const isProduction =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ||
  process.env.DOCKER_ENV ||
  fs.existsSync('/.dockerenv');
```

### Component Behaviors

#### **link-packages-to-root.sh**

```bash
# Production: Original one-liner
find dist -name package.json | xargs npm link

# Development: Enhanced with error handling + selective linking
```

#### **webpack configs**

```javascript
// Production: Original block watching
compilation.contextDependencies.add(path.resolve(__dirname, '../blocks'));

// Development: Smart individual block watching + build coordination
```

#### **blocks-builder.ts**

```javascript
// Production: Simple full builds
await execAsync('nx run-many -t build -p blocks-*');

// Development: Incremental builds based on modification times
```

## Performance Comparison

| Operation           | Production   | Development  | Improvement      |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Single block change | 60-120s      | 5-15s        | **8x faster**    |
| Server restart      | Both rebuild | One rebuilds | **2x less work** |
| Package linking     | All blocks   | Changed only | **10x faster**   |
| First build         | ~2 minutes   | ~2 minutes   | Same             |
| Hot reload          | 60-120s      | 5-15s        | **8x faster**    |

## Troubleshooting

### Production Issues

- ‚úÖ **Always stable**: Uses original main branch approach
- ‚úÖ **No complex scripts**: Simple npm linking only
- ‚úÖ **Predictable**: Same behavior as before improvements

### Development Issues

#### Blocks Not Updating

1. Check if block was actually built: `ls dist/packages/blocks/[block-name]`
2. Verify linking: `npm ls -g | grep @openops/blocks-[block-name]`
3. Clear cache: `rm -rf dist/` and rebuild

#### Build Errors

- Individual block build errors won't crash the entire system
- Check webpack console for specific block issues
- Use `npm run build:blocks [block-name]` to test specific blocks

#### Runtime Module Loading Issues

If you see "Cannot find module '@openops/block-xxx'" errors:

1. **Check local symlinks**: `ls -la node_modules/@openops/block-*`
2. **Rebuild and relink**: `npm run build:blocks:changed && npm run link:blocks:engine`
3. **Manual fix**: Run the engine linking script:
   ```bash
   ./tools/link-blocks-for-engine.sh
   ```

#### Switch to Production Mode Locally

If development mode causes issues, you can force production behavior:

```bash
export NODE_ENV=production
npm run dev
```

### Slow Performance Still?

1. Ensure you're using the new system: Look for "Building X changed blocks" messages
2. Check if you have many blocks with changes: `git status packages/blocks/`
3. Consider using `pnpm` for even faster package operations

## Files Modified for Environment Separation

1. **`Dockerfile`**: Uses original simple production approach
2. **`tools/link-packages-to-root.sh`**: Environment-aware linking
3. **`packages/server/api/webpack.config.js`**: Conditional smart watching
4. **`packages/engine/webpack.config.js`**: Conditional smart watching
5. **`packages/server/shared/src/lib/blocks-builder.ts`**: Environment-aware building
